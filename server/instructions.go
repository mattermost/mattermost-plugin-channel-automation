const channelAutomationInstructionsBase = `Channel automations are trigger-action workflows that fire when events occur.

PERMISSION PREFLIGHT — VERIFY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE:
The user must have permission to create an automation for the trigger they are asking about, otherwise create_automation will fail. Verify up-front so you don't waste the user's time gathering details for an automation they cannot create. The user is permitted when ANY of the following is true:
- They are a system administrator. The agent context surfaces this as "System role: System Administrator" — if you see that line, permission is granted; skip the rest of this preflight.
- The trigger fires in a direct message (DM) or group message (GM) channel and the user is a participant. DMs/GMs have no channel-admin role, so any participant may create an automation for that channel.
- They are a channel admin of the trigger channel (for message_posted, schedule, membership_changed triggers in regular public/private channels).
- They are a team admin of the trigger team (for the channel_created and user_joined_team triggers, which are scoped by team_id rather than channel_id).

How to check the channel role: call get_channel_info with the trigger channel_id. The response includes the requesting user's role in that channel as one of "admin", "member", "guest", or "not_member". Only "admin" satisfies the channel-admin requirement. Channel type "D" (DM) or "G" (GM) on the returned channel also satisfies the requirement regardless of role. For team-scoped triggers (channel_created, user_joined_team) you cannot verify team admin from get_channel_info; tell the user that team admin permission on the target team is required and proceed only if they confirm they have it (or are a system admin).

If the user does NOT have permission, stop and explain which role they need (system admin, channel admin of <channel>, team admin of <team>, or that the trigger must be in a DM/GM).

AGENT DISCOVERY: For an ai_prompt action with provider_type "agent", use the list_agents tool to discover bots.
Each agent's ID is a 26-character Mattermost user ID — use that value as provider_id in the ai_prompt config.

IMPORTANT WORKFLOW — ALWAYS CONFIRM BEFORE CREATING:
Before calling create_automation (or update_automation), you MUST present a plain-language summary to the user and get their
explicit confirmation. Even if the user provided all details, always present the full summary.

The summary MUST use exactly four numbered items in this order (do not merge or skip any;
users rely on this structure to understand risk before they confirm):
1. TRIGGER: What event fires this automation and its scope.
2. AI TOOLS: Which tools the AI agent will have access to and what each one can do.
   - Without tools, the agent can only generate text from its built-in knowledge — it cannot
     read any Mattermost data or take any actions.
   - With tools, the agent inherits YOUR permissions — it can access anything you can access.
     Explain what each granted tool does so the user understands the access they are giving.
3. GUARDRAILS: Dedicated step — do not fold this into item 2. Reference the "MATTERMOST MCP CHANNEL
   GUARDRAILS" list below. For each ai_prompt step that uses allowed_tools AND includes at least
   one guardrail-constrained Mattermost tool name (channel- or team-scoped), state the exact
   guardrails.channel_ids you will set (list each 26-char channel ID or say you will use the
   trigger channel / template such as {{.Trigger.Channel.Id}}). If no ai_prompt step uses
   allowed_tools, write "Not applicable — no MCP tools in this automation." If allowed_tools uses
   only external MCP tools and/or unconstrained Mattermost tools (none of the constrained names
   below), write "Not applicable — no guardrail-constrained Mattermost MCP tools in this
   automation." If guardrail-constrained Mattermost tools are used where outcomes may be visible
   to others (public or private channel with members) and the user chose no guardrails, state
   that explicitly and require them to acknowledge cross-channel leakage risk. Otherwise explain
   why the chosen channel_ids limit Mattermost tool reads/writes to what the user should expect.
4. OUTPUT: Where the automation will post results — name the specific channel(s).

Format as that four-part numbered list (1–4), then ask the user to confirm. Only call create_automation after
the user says yes.

If the user's request is missing details (trigger channel, output channel, which tools),
ask clarifying questions BEFORE presenting the summary.

MATTERMOST MCP CHANNEL GUARDRAILS — WHICH TOOL NAMES ARE CONSTRAINED:
Channel guardrails (guardrails.channel_ids on an ai_prompt) constrain a fixed set of built-in
Mattermost MCP tools. The exact tool names below are matched against tool discovery output;
any other tool name (including external MCP tools) passes through unchanged when guardrails are set.

Channel-scoped — restricted to guardrails.channel_ids. Tools differ in how they're
constrained:

Tools that REQUIRE a channel_id argument matching guardrails.channel_ids:
- search_posts
- read_channel
- get_channel_members
- add_user_to_channel
- get_channel_info

Tools that take a post_id; the post's resolved channel_id must be in guardrails.channel_ids:
- read_post

Tools that are NOT permitted when channel guardrails are configured (the
automation save/run will reject them):
- get_user_channels

Team-scoped — the tool's team_id argument must be the team that owns one of the allowed
channels (channel→team is resolved automatically from guardrails.channel_ids), or the
trigger team for channel_created/user_joined_team automations:
- get_team_info
- get_team_members
- create_channel (the new channel must be created in an allowed team)

Other built-in Mattermost MCP tools (search_users, list_agents) may be used in allowed_tools
but are NOT constrained by channel guardrails — they execute with the automation owner's full
permissions regardless of guardrails.channel_ids. Mention this explicitly in summary item 2
when granting them.

Mutating tools that act on the user's behalf (create_post, dm, group_message) and the
automation-management tools (list_automations, get_automation_instructions, create_automation,
update_automation, delete_automation) are rejected from allowed_tools entirely — guardrails
do not unlock them. Use a send_message or send_dm action instead of granting the posting
tools; never include the automation-management tools.

External MCP tools (anything not in the lists above) are unaffected by channel guardrails and
pass through unchanged. You may freely mix external tools with Mattermost tools in a single
ai_prompt step's allowed_tools — there is no need to split into multiple ai_prompt steps just
to combine them. Hook URLs are only registered for the constrained Mattermost tool names above,
so unknown names do not cause runtime failures.

If every tool in allowed_tools across all ai_prompt steps is external-only or in the
unconstrained Mattermost set (none of the constrained names above), omit guardrails — use
summary item 3 to say "Not applicable — no guardrail-constrained Mattermost MCP tools in
this automation."

ACTION SELECTION: For each step in the automation, choose the right action type:
- send_message / send_dm: for posting text to channels or users.
- ai_prompt with allowed_tools: for anything else — any step that needs to read data, modify state, or interact with Mattermost beyond posting text. Discover tools via the AI bridge GET .../agents/{id}/tools (or list_tools); each allowed_tools entry is the tool name string from discovery (e.g. "search_posts").
If a step cannot be accomplished with send_message or send_dm, it MUST be an ai_prompt action with the appropriate tools.

TOOL SUFFICIENCY CHECK (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT): Before presenting the summary, think through the automation's task
step-by-step and verify the granted tools cover every step the agent will need to perform.
Ask: what data does the agent need to discover, read, or act on — and can it actually do
each of those things with only the tools listed? If any step requires a tool that isn't
included, add it to your recommendation and explain why it's needed.

TRIGGERS: Set exactly one trigger type inside the "trigger" object.
- "message_posted": fires when a human user posts a message in the channel. Bot messages are automatically filtered out, so there is no risk of bot-triggered loops. High-traffic channels will trigger frequently.
  {"trigger": {"message_posted": {"channel_id": "<channel-id>"}}}
- "schedule": fires on a recurring schedule.
  - interval: Go duration string (minimum "1h"). Examples: "1h" (hourly), "24h" (daily), "168h" (weekly).
  - start_at (optional): unix timestamp in milliseconds (UTC) for the first run — must be in the future. The automation fires at this time, then repeats every interval. If omitted, the first run happens immediately. Use this to schedule a daily recap at e.g. 9am.
  {"trigger": {"schedule": {"channel_id": "<channel-id>", "interval": "24h", "start_at": 1899936000000}}}
- "membership_changed": fires when a member joins or leaves the channel.
  {"trigger": {"membership_changed": {"channel_id": "<channel-id>"}}}
- "channel_created": fires when a new public channel is created on the specified team. Requires team_id; fires for every new public channel created on that team by any user.
  {"trigger": {"channel_created": {"team_id": "<team-id>"}}}
- "user_joined_team": fires when a non-bot user joins the specified team.
  {"trigger": {"user_joined_team": {"team_id": "<team-id>"}}}

ACTIONS: Ordered array executed sequentially. Each action has a unique "id" (lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only, e.g. "generate-recap" not "generate_recap") and exactly one action config.
Action types:
1. "send_message": Posts a message as a bot.
   {"id": "post", "send_message": {"channel_id": "<ch>", "body": "Hello!", "reply_to_post_id": "<optional post id>", "as_bot_id": "<optional bot user id>"}}
   - as_bot_id (optional): the Mattermost user ID of the bot to post as. Must be a bot account. If omitted, the message is posted as the default automation bot. Use list_agents to find bot IDs. When chaining after an ai_prompt action, set this to the same agent's user ID so the message appears to come from that agent.
2. "ai_prompt": Runs an AI agent with a prompt and optional tools. With tools, the agent can perform actions (e.g. modify channels, manage members, search) — not just generate text. Does NOT post a message — chain a send_message or send_dm action after to post the response.
   {"id": "ask", "ai_prompt": {"prompt": "...", "provider_type": "agent", "provider_id": "<agent-user-id>", "system_prompt": "...", "allowed_tools": ["<tool name from discovery>", "..."], "guardrails": {"channel_ids": ["<26-char channel id>", "..."]}}}
   - provider_type: "agent" (a bot) or "service" (a raw LLM service)
   - provider_id: the agent's Mattermost user ID (26-char ID). Call list_agents to discover available agents and their IDs.
   - system_prompt (optional): system instructions for the AI
   - allowed_tools: list of tool name strings the AI agent is allowed to call (names must match bridge/agent tools discovery exactly; discovery lists MCP and embedded tools only, not built-in Mattermost agent tools). WITHOUT this, the agent has NO tool access and can only generate text from its built-in knowledge — it cannot read any Mattermost data or take any actions. With tools, the agent inherits the creating user's permissions and can access anything they can access. IMPORTANT: Only include tools the user has explicitly agreed to. Always explain what each tool does in your summary. Prefer the minimum set of tools needed.
   - guardrails (optional): {"channel_ids": ["<26-char channel id>", "..."]}. When channel_ids is
     non-empty AND allowed_tools is set, hooks constrain the built-in Mattermost MCP tools listed
     in the "MATTERMOST MCP CHANNEL GUARDRAILS" section below (channel-scoped tools like
     search_posts/read_channel/get_channel_info/etc., plus the team-scoped get_team_info and
     get_team_members which derive their allowed teams from the channels' teams). Omit guardrails
     when allowed_tools for that step contains no constrained Mattermost names. External tools and
     unconstrained Mattermost tools (search_users, list_agents) may be mixed in
     the same step alongside constrained tools — they pass through unchanged. Prefer the trigger
     channel ID or a small explicit channel_ids set the user agrees to when guardrails apply.
   TOOL SELECTION: Use bridge agent tools discovery or list_tools; copy each tool's name from the response.
   DYNAMIC DISCOVERY: The AI agent can use its tools at runtime to discover resources (e.g., find channels, look up users) — don't hardcode IDs into the prompt when the agent can discover them dynamically each run. This keeps automations resilient to changes like new channels being added.
   NOTE: "web_search" is NOT a valid tool name in allowed_tools. Web search is a native provider feature that works automatically if the agent has it enabled — do not include it in allowed_tools.
3. "send_dm": Sends a direct message to a user as a bot. Creates the DM channel automatically if it doesn't exist.
   {"id": "welcome", "send_dm": {"user_id": "{{.Trigger.User.Id}}", "body": "Welcome!", "as_bot_id": "<bot-user-id>"}}
   - user_id (required): the Mattermost user ID to DM. Supports template syntax.
   - body (required): the message content. Supports template syntax.
   - as_bot_id (required): the bot user ID to send the DM as. Use list_agents to find bot IDs.

TEMPLATE SYNTAX: body, channel_id, reply_to_post_id, prompt, and system_prompt support Go text/template with this context.
For send_message channel_id, always use {{.Trigger.Channel.Id}}.
- {{.Trigger.Post.Message}}, {{.Trigger.Post.Id}}, {{.Trigger.Post.ChannelId}}
- {{.Trigger.Channel.Id}}, {{.Trigger.Channel.Name}}, {{.Trigger.Channel.DisplayName}}
- {{.Trigger.User.Id}}, {{.Trigger.User.Username}}, {{.Trigger.User.FirstName}}, {{.Trigger.User.LastName}}
- {{.Trigger.Team.Id}}, {{.Trigger.Team.Name}}, {{.Trigger.Team.DisplayName}}, {{.Trigger.Team.DefaultChannelId}}
- {{(index .Steps "prev-action-id").Message}}, {{(index .Steps "prev-action-id").PostID}} — output from a previous action

CHAINING ACTIONS: A single ai_prompt action can call tools multiple times AND generate a text response in one step — prefer consolidating related work into one ai_prompt rather than splitting into many actions. Use {{(index .Steps "prev-action-id").Message}} in later actions to reference the text output of a previous ai_prompt.`
